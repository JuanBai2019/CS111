lab0.c
	The executable c source code for project 0. It implements stdin/stdout and redirections. It also has segmentation fault and segmentation handler with catch options functionalities.

Makefile
	default: build the lab0 executable with the -Wall and -Wextra options.
	check: runs a quick smoke-test for the program.
	clean: delete all files created by the Makefile, and return the directory to its freshly untarred state.
	dist: build the distribution tarball.

Using "smoke test" to check the progrom's functionalities:
       	 Check input redirection is working properly by running the program with input file and creat a output file
	 check output redirection is working properly by comparing the input.txt and output.txt files to see if they are the same 
	 check the segmentation handler works by running --segfault and --catch together. 
	 check segmentation argument is creating correctly.
