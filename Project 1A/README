Research references:
	 For coding part I used TA's powerpoint and washed his vedio, and I used almost all of the pseudocode that he lectured.
	 For non-canonical input mode I read general terminal interface page:https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xbd/termios.html#:~:text=In%20non%2Dcanonical%20mode%20input,to%20process%20the%20bytes%20received.
	 For understanding the usege of some of functions I reead Linux man page:https://linux.die.net/man/3/tcgetattr.
