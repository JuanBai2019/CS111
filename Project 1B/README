Description of included files:

lab1b-client.c:
	The client program will open a connection to a server (port specified with the mandatory --port= command line parameter) rather than sending it directly to a shell. The client should then send input from the keyboard to the socket (while echoing to the display), and input from the socket to the display.

lab1b-server.c:
	The server program will connect with the client, receive the client's commands and send them to the shell, and will "serve" the client the outputs of some commands such as --port = command line parameter and --shell = option.


Makefile:
	Makefile has default clean and dist targets as following
	default:
	clean:
	dist:

Testing methodology:
	I use port number to connect client and server and ran different test such as --log = log_file,--compress etc to debug. 
	Unfortunately, I could not get compress to work correctly. 


Reaserch references:
	  For coding part I used TA's powerpoint and washed his vedio, and I used almost all of the pseudocode that he lectured.
	  And read piazza's questions.
