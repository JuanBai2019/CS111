lab4c_tcp.c and lab4c_tls.c:
	C source files for two embedded applications (lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls) that build and run (with no errors or warnings) on a Beaglebone.

Makefile:
	A Makefile to build and test your application. The higher level targets should include:
	default: build both versions of your program (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options).
	clean: delete all programs and output created by the Makefile and restore the directory to its freshly untarred state.
	dist: create the deliverable tarball.

README:
	A README file contains descriptions of each of the included files.
	

Research references:
    For coding part I used TA's powerpoint and washed his vedio, and I used almost all of the pseudocode that he lectured. I also get benefited from pizze.
